Thank you for your being an awesome person and helping to find issues and projects that the Flatiron Open Source Society can try to tackle.

Right now, things are pretty informal.  If you've found a project or issue that you think is worth tackling as part of our open source push, add it to the list.  Include links and notes that you think would be helpful.
